            <h2 class="no-underline">History of Thailand</h2>
                        <p> Thailand's history can be broadly divided into several periods, including ancient kingdoms, the Rise of the Thai, and the modern era. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The ancient period saw the influence of Indian culture and the rise of the Khmer Empire, while the 13th century marked the emergence of independent Thai kingdoms like Sukhothai.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Ayutthaya period, beginning in the 14th century, saw the rise of a powerful Thai kingdom, and Siam (Thailand's former name) avoided colonial domination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern Thailand emerged in the late 18th century with the founding of the Chakri Dynasty, followed by reforms and modernization under kings like Mongkut and Chulalongkorn.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 20th century saw a shift to a constitutional monarchy in 1932 and changes to the name to Thailand in 1939.
