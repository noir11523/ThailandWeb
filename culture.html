            <p>Thai culture is a blend of various influences, including Buddhism, Indian, Chinese, and indigenous traditions. Buddhism, particularly Theravada Buddhism, deeply permeates daily life, shaping values and practices. Respect, politeness, and humility are highly valued, especially towards elders and royalty. The emphasis on family and community is strong, as is the connection to the natural world, particularly rice cultivation.</p>
